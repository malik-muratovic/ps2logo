   About ps2logo
---=============---

The first 12 sectors of every PS2 game disc contain the PS2 boot logo in a
slightly encrypted form. You can use ps2logo to decrypt a sector dump, and then
open the logo in a picture viewer.

For more information, I recommend reading doc/ps2boot.txt written by loser.


---==---
   Build
---=====---

To compile ps2logo, you need CMake and a C compiler like gcc.
I recommend doing an out-of-source build:
$ mkdir build
$ cd build
$ cmake ../src/
$ make

To install ps2logo:
# make install


---==---
   Usage
---=====---

usage: ps2logo <input file> <output file>

Decrypt encrypted logo in <input file> to <output file>.


---====--
   Sample
---======---

To extract the logo from a PS2 game disc, do the following:

Dump the first 12 sectors of the disc:
$ dd if=/dev/cdrom of=logo.enc bs=2048 count=12

Decrypt the sector dump:
$ ps2logo logo.enc logo.raw

Then open the raw file in your picture viewer with these settings:
- width and height: PAL 344x71, NTSC 384x64
- one channel (grayscale)

You should now see the "PlayStation(R) 2" logo.
Optionally, save the image as JPEG, for instance.
