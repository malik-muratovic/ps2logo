   About ps2logo
---=============---

The first 12 sectors of every PS2 game disc contain the PS2 boot logo in a
slightly encrypted form. You can use ps2logo to decrypt a sector dump, and then
convert the raw image to JPEG or whatever.

For more information, I recommend reading doc/ps2boot.txt written by loser.


---==---
   Build
---=====---

To compile ps2logo, you need CMake and a C compiler like gcc.
I recommend doing an out-of-source build:
$ mkdir build
$ cd build
$ cmake ../src/
$ make

To install ps2logo:
# make install


---==---
   Usage
---=====---

usage: ps2logo <input file> <output file>

Decrypt encrypted logo in <input file> to <output file>.


---====--
   Sample
---======---

This sample is for Linux users. On Windows, you can alternatively use Hex
Workshop to dump the sectors and Paint Shop Pro to convert the image.

To extract the logo from a PS2 game disc, do the following:

Dump the first 12 sectors of the disc:
$ dd if=/dev/cdrom of=logo.enc bs=2048 count=12

Decrypt the sector dump:
$ ps2logo logo.enc logo.raw

Use ImageMagick to convert the raw image to JPEG:
$ convert -depth 8 -size 344x71 gray:logo.raw logo.jpg

Note that the image width and height depend on the region: 344x71 for PAL and
384x64 for NTSC.

Open the file in a picture viewer and you should finally see the PS2 logo...
