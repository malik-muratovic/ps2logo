   About ps2logo
---=============---

The first 12 sectors of every PS2 game disc contain the PS2 boot logo in a
slightly encrypted form. You can use ps2logo to decrypt a sector dump, and then
open the logo in a picture viewer.

For more information, I recommend reading doc/ps2boot.txt written by loser.


---==---
   Build
---=====---

To compile ps2logo, you need CMake and a C compiler like gcc.
I recommend doing an out-of-source build:
$ mkdir build
$ cd build
$ cmake ../src/
$ make

To install ps2logo:
# make install

   Usage

TODO

How to extract the PS2 logo from a PS2 game disc (CD/DVD)?

- use Hex Workshop to dump the first 12 sectors (0 to 11) of the disc to the
  file sectordump.bin
- decrypt sectordump.bin with ps2logo; name of the output file: logo.raw
- open logo.raw in Paint Shop Pro, set width and height (PAL: 344x71, NTSC:
  384x64), one channel (grayscale)
- you should now see the "PlayStation(R) 2" logo
- save the image as JPEG, for instance
